# Project Title: Restaurant Picker Capstone Project

## Team Members: Devin Sprinkle, Joe Green, Brandon Pecher, Emmet Quint

### The Need

Potential users for our capstone project include individuals who are looking for a quick and easy way to find nearby restaurants and decide where to eat. They may face issues with indecision or simply want to discover new places to dine in their area. The project could serve as a foundation for developing a more comprehensive platform in the future, including a web-hosted version.

### Our Solution

**Product Name**: Restaurant Picker

**Product Type**: Windows PC Program (with potential for web-hosting)

Our capstone project, Restaurant Picker, is a simple Windows application developed using C#. It uses the Yelp API to search for restaurants in the user's area and the Google Maps API to retrieve restaurant reviews. The program displays a list of nearby restaurants with their names, addresses, and reviews, allowing users to either choose a restaurant from the list or have the program randomly select one for them. Users can also view a history of their previously recommended restaurants. In the future, there is potential to expand the project to a web-hosted platform.

### The Competition

1. **Competing Product**: OpenTable
    - URL: https://www.opentable.com/
    - OpenTable is a competing product as it allows users to find nearby restaurants and make reservations directly through the app.
2. **Competing Product**: Zomato
    - URL: https://www.zomato.com/
    - Zomato is a competing product as it offers restaurant recommendations, reviews, and menus, allowing users to discover new dining options in their area.
3. **Competing Product**: Google Maps
    - URL: https://maps.google.com/
    - Google Maps is a competing product as it provides users with information on nearby restaurants, including location, hours, and user reviews.

Our capstone project, Restaurant Picker, differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on simplicity and providing a streamlined decision-making process for users. It specifically targets individuals looking for a quick and easy way to choose a restaurant without being overwhelmed by extensive reviews, ratings, or reservation options. The potential for web-hosting adds flexibility and increased accessibility for users.

### Scope

- Platform: Windows PC (with potential for web-hosting)
- Minimum Requirements: .NET Framework 4.5 or higher, Internet access, Yelp API Key, Google Maps API Key
- Language: C#
- Technologies: Yelp API, Google Maps API
- Project Limitations: The program does not provide reservation options.
- Minimum Criteria for Success:
    1. Users can search for nearby restaurants based on their current location.
    2. Users can view a list of restaurants with names, addresses, and reviews.
    3. Users can either choose a restaurant from the list or have the program randomly pick one for them.
    4. Users can view a history of previously recommended restaurants.
- Additional Criteria (if time permits):
    1. Users can filter restaurant search results based on cuisine or distance.
    2. Users can view basic information about selected restaurants, such as hours of operation and contact information.
    3. Users can save favorite restaurants for easy access in the future.

### Potential Pitfalls

    1. Learning new APIs: Team members may need to learn how to use the Yelp API and Google Maps API effectively. To mitigate this issue, team members can review API documentation and examples before starting development.
    2. App deployment: Team members may need to learn how to package and distribute the program for Windows PC. To minimize this issue, team members can research the packagingand distribution process for Windows applications and allocate sufficient time to ensure successful program deployment.
    3. Web-hosting: If the project expands to a web-hosted platform, team members may need to learn about web development technologies, hosting solutions, and securing user data. To address this challenge, team members can familiarize themselves with relevant technologies and best practices, as well as allocate time for proper implementation and testing.
    4. API rate limits: Yelp and Google Maps APIs have rate limits that restrict the number of requests that can be made within a certain period. To handle this issue, team members should design the application to handle API rate limit errors gracefully and inform users when these limits are reached.

### Conclusion

The Restaurant Picker Capstone Project aims to provide users with a simple, streamlined way to discover and choose nearby restaurants based on their current location. By leveraging the Yelp API and Google Maps API, the application will display a list of restaurants with names, addresses, and reviews, allowing users to make informed decisions. The project has the potential to expand to a web-hosted platform, increasing its accessibility and user base. To ensure success, the team will need to effectively learn and utilize APIs, deploy the program on Windows PCs, and handle potential pitfalls such as rate limits and web-hosting challenges.
